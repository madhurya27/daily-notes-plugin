# Decisions

Smaller design decisions. Anything whose reversal means migrating data or
rewriting across layers belongs in [`adr/`](adr/) instead.

## 2026-09-15 — Editing is an action on the note, not an editor in the stream

**Decision:** the stream stays read-only. Editing is a per-note action — open
the file in a split, or append to today's note.

**Why:** live updates, collapsing and the e2e suite all follow from rendering
the Markdown ourselves.

**Rejected:** inline editors per note, as
[Daily Notes Editor](https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Daily-Notes-Editor)
does — four prototype patches, and why its view cannot react to vault events.

**Rejected:** no edit affordance at all — a spotted typo has nowhere to go.
